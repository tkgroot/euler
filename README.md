My take on solving the problems presented by the project euler.
I'm trying to build a nice framework around it, actively writing tests
for every problem I solve and evaluate the time the code takes to execute.

This is work in progress.

## Contributing

I don't expect any contributions to this project. If however you want to start yourself
visit the [ProjectEuler Homepage](https://projecteuler.net/).

However if you want to leave tips and tricks on my poorly coded solutions, you can
create an issue.
